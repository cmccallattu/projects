        <p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Begin by dicing the large onion, mincing all of the garlic, dicing the carrot, cutting the celery,<br>and cutting the chicken breast into bite-sized pieces
</p>
        <p><strong>Step 2:</strong> Once you have prepared these ingredients, you may begin to prepare your brown roux. Start<br> melting the stick and a half of butter in a large pan. Once this has fully melted, add your cup and a half<br> of flour.You will need to begin stirring this flour in immediately to help break up clumps. Your roux<br> should be on medium heat at this point. Keep an eye on your roux and stir periodically to keep from <br>burning. 
        </p>
        <p><strong>Step 3:</strong> Once the roux is going, you will need to coat the bottom of your large stock pot with olive oil <br> and begin cooking your onions on medium high heat after the oil has heated up. After a few minutes<br>of cooking the onions you will add the diced carrot and celery. Stir briskly and allow these vegetables<br> to sweat for a few minutes before adding the garlic. Allow the garlic to sweat for an additional few<br> minutes before you start adding the chicken stock. Go ahead and add all of the chicken stock and turn<br> up the heat to high. Once this mixture begins to boil, add the beer and allow that to cook off for a few<br> minutes. Allow the mixture to begin boiling again before adding the chicken, seasoning and hot sauce.
        </p>
        <p> At this point you can add the  can of crushed tomato to the stock pot and bring everything to a high<br>simmer.
